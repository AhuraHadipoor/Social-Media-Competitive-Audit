# Competitive Audit of Iranian Accommodation Reservation Companies ðŸ¤³

## Introduction ðŸ“š
This project is a competitive audit of Iranian companies operating in the accommodation reservation industry. The goal was to analyze their digital presence, product performance, and customer engagement across different platforms, including websites, mobile applications, and social media.

## Background ðŸ“¢
In an increasingly competitive digital landscape, understanding how businesses perform relative to their competitors is crucial. This audit focuses on evaluating:
- Website and mobile app usability
- Social media engagement (likes, views, and comments on the latest 10 posts)
- App store ratings and reviews
- Insights into engagement metrics relative to follower count

By conducting this research, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of digital marketing strategies, user engagement patterns, and areas of improvement within this industry.

## Tools Used ðŸ› 
- **Google Sheets**: Data collection, analysis, and visualization
- **Social Media Platforms (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)**: Performance analysis
- **App Stores (Google Play, Cafe Bazaar, Myket)**: Rating and review analysis

## Things I Learned ðŸ”‘
- How to conduct a structured competitive audit
- The importance of engagement rates over vanity metrics
- How to build a data-driven dashboard for visualizing insights
- The role of customer reviews in app store rankings and user trust
- Variations in engagement patterns across different social media platforms

## How It Works ðŸ’»
1. **Website & App Review**: I navigated through selected companies' websites and mobile apps to assess usability and key features.
2. **Social Media Audit**: I collected engagement metrics (likes, comments, and views) for the latest 10 posts of each company and analyzed them in relation to their follower count.
3. **App Store Evaluation**: I gathered user ratings and reviews from Google Play, Myket, and Cafe Bazaar.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: I used Google Sheets to visualize the data and identify trends and key insights.
